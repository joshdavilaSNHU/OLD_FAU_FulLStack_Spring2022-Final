I will be creating a movie app using HTML, CSS, Javascript, IMdb API, mongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, PostMan, and Firebase Authentication.

Originally, I wanted to create a React app using the IMdb API but found that I did not know enough about react.

I also used api.themoviedb.org instead of IMdb API as I found moviedb the same as IMdb. There were also a lot more tutorials with movieDB instead of IMdb.

# IMdb API versus movieDB API

    I signed up, got my API, but could not find tutorials on how to implement them into my code. I assumed that I would be able to take an already coded API and just change out the links, but that did not work for me. After spending hours on IMdb, I felt that there were more options and tutorials using movieDB API.

# Postman:
    Using IMdb API and Postman, I was able to GET information from the actual API. I assumed this meant I was working well with the API but for some reason, implementing it into my code was not working.

# Notes:
    Going through this project was definitely an eye opener on how terrible I am with backend processes. I admit, my HTML/CSS skills in the particular project are lacking as I tried to focus figuring out Firebase and React. 

    While taking Intro to Internet at the same time as Full Stack was not my choice, I figured I could do well in this class as a whole.
